# Text-Reader

This code is an implementation of an application for reading text from a PDF file or text inputted by the user. The application uses the Tkinter and ttkbootstrap libraries for creating the graphical interface and the gTTS and PyPDF2 libraries for reading text from a PDF file and converting the text to speech. Pygame is used for playing the sound generated by gTTS.


The application allows the user to select the language in which the sound is generated from the text. The user can choose to read the text from a PDF file or enter it manually. The PDF file is selected by the user using a dialog box. After selecting the file or entering the text, the application allows the text to be played as speech.


The application sets the icon of its window to the 'favicon.ico' file and sets the background of the window to the 'Text_Reader_background.png' file.

Using the PyInstaller library, I created an executable file that can be run without the need for a Python interpreter on the user's computer.

The executable file located is in this repository: https://github.com/Michal-Grzegorzek/Text-Reader-Desktop-App-Executable-File.git

Download all files to one folder and run the main.exe.
